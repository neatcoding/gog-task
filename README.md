<h1>GOG Task</h1>


<h2>Angular</h2>

Game data is stored in app/data/gamesData.json (which can be generated by Symfony).
Note: it would be faster for user to just put it in HTML of the site.

I use page route just to demonstrate. Should remove it for SEO purposes.

gogPriceSlider directive is created to have customized slider coming from my hands.


<h2>Grunt</h2>

Grunt combines javascript to one file with uglify.
It is ready to use coffeescript (compile before uglify).


<h2>Styles</h2>

I reduced grey colors, because you shouldn't use so many colors in a project. :)

CSS mapping is enabled in config.rb, so You can see see .scss file and line easily in chrome (enable css source maps in devtools options).


<h2>Cross-Browsing</h2>

Works in IE9+
