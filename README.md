GOG Task


ANGULAR

Game data is stored in app/data/gamesData.json (which can be generated by Symfony).
Note: it would be faster for user to just put it in HTML of the site.

I use page route just to demonstrate.


GRUNT

Grunt combines javascript to one file with uglify.
It is ready to use coffeescript (compile before uglify).


STYLES

I reduced grey colors, because you shouldn't use so many colors.

CSS mapping is enabled in config.rb, so You can see see .scss file and line easily in chrome (enable css source maps in devtools options).
